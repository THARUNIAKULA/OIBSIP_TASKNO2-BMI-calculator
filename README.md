Project Idea : BMI CALCULATOR

Project Description:
○ Develop a graphical BMI calculator with a user-friendly interface (GUI) using libraries like Tkinter or PyQt.
○ Prompts users for their weight (in kilograms) and height (in meters). Allows users to input weight and height.
○ Calculates the BMI and classifies it into categories (e.g., underweight, normal, overweight) based on predefined ranges.
○ Displays the BMI result and category to the user.

Key Concepts and Challenges Satisfied:
○ User Input Validation: Ensure valid user inputs within reasonable ranges and handle errors gracefully.
○ BMI Calculation: Accurately implement the BMI formula.
○ Categorization: Classify BMI values into health categories based on predefined ranges.
○ GUI Design: Create an intuitive interface with labels, input fields, and result displays using Tkinter.
